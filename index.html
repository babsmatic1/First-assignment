    <h1>My First Webpage</h1>
    <p><i>First of all, some people may wonder why they should bother with landing pages when the primary objective is to drive visitors to their homepage? <br>The answer is that, while getting traffic on your home page is undoubtedly a good thing, it is less likely to result in a conversion than a landing page. Home pages contain a lot of information and invite users to navigate to a variety of different locations. If a visitor reaches your homepage with one specific goal in mind, they might be turned off if they have to look through several different services and product options first. The homepageâ€™s main objective is to direct users to other pages where they will find the information they want. Landing pages eliminate the intermediary step by being the page the user wants - and stating as much in no uncertain terms.
        Your homepage is general where a landing page is focused and specific. While the homepage draws visitors further into your website by presenting all the options your business has to offer, a landing page offers one simple and clear call to action.
       Getting a lead-generation or lead-capture landing page is primarily intended to collect leads by means of a data capture form.</i></p>
